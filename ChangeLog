 - Add replacement model for tension for the constitutive models `Baro-Ko15`, `Baro-Sc18` and `Baro-Ko21`.
   This uses an additional state variable to save the replacement stiffness for these models.
 - Add additional parameter `setting_epsilon_extra` to allow for higher precision in some functions in `Math_Operations`.
   Most notably this prevents issues encountered with small values using `Sqrt_Of_Sum_Of_Squares()` and `Givens_CS()`.
 - Add interactive help as html pages with example scripts on how to use the xMat


xMat 0.858

 - First public release of the version used in the PhD thesis from February 2023
