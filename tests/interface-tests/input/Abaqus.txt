This is not an interface test but an example on how to use the xMat with Abaqus:

 - copy `xmat.f` to the working directory of your Abaqus job.
 - If it should be used in an Abaqus/Standard simulation, make sure that
   the macro `ABQ_STD_CALLING` is defined when the xMat is compiled.
   Typically you might want to pass `-DABAQUS_CALLING` to the compiler
   and have something like the following above the module `General_Settings` in `xmat.f`:

#ifdef ABAQUS_CALLING
#define ABQ_STD_CALLING
#endif

 - If it should be used in an Abaqus/Explicit simulation,
   use the macro `ABQ_EXP_CALLING` instead.
   The compiler can use the same `-DABAQUS_CALLING` if in the file `xmat.f`
   the statement from above is adjusted to

#ifdef ABAQUS_CALLING
#define ABQ_EXP_CALLING
#endif

 - Since the xMat is programmed in free-Format, you have to give an appropriate flag to the compiler
   (`-free` for Intel Fortran compiler or `-ffree-form` for GNU Fortran compiler)
 - By default, Abaqus should have the preprocessor activated.
   Otherwise pass the appropriate flag to the compiler
   (`-fpp` for Intel Fortran compiler or `-cpp` for GNU Fortran compiler)

To pass specific compiler flags to Abaqus for user routine compilation,
the "compile_fortran" command has to be adjusted in an environment file.
There are two ways to accomplish this:

By default, Abaqus uses the system-wide environment file within the Abaqus installation
similar to <Abaqus-install-dir>/linux_a64/SMA/site/lnx86_64.env for Linux and
<Abaqus-install-dir>/win_b64/SMA/site/win86_64.env for Windows.

But instead of modyfing the system-wide file directly,
it is recommended to create a local file named "abaqus_v6.env"
in the working directory used by Abaqus and where "xmat.f" is.

For using the xMat it is sufficient to copy the whole "compile_fortran"
from the system-wide environment in there and adjust it.
With some bookkeeping it should look like the following.
For more help on setting up a local environment file in general, consult your Abaqus manual.

---

import os

# Copy all required variable definitions used in "compile_fortran" here from system-wide-environment file.
# As of this writing the line defining "abaHomeInc" is required.
abaHomeInc = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.environ.get('ABA_HOME', ''), os.pardir)) 

# Copy the whole "compile_fortran" command here. Insert all required arguments in an additional line.
# Using the Intel Fortran compiler, this could look like the following
compile_fortran = ['ifort',
                   '-free', '-DABAQUS_CALLING',       # <-- this line is important for use with xMat
                   # In Windows, initiate both arguments with "/" instead of "-".
                   # Also add all other lines  of the "compile_fortran" command from system-wide-environment file
                   ]

# Explicitly delete all local variables used (currently only abaHomeInc)
del abaHomeInc
